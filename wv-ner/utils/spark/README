The parser is based on a context-free grammar for Swedish and an Earley parser implemented in python by John Aycock (SPARK-0.6.1).

Warning! The parser is UNDER DEVELOPMENT!
Please send comments to bea@stp.lingfil.uu.se

Files included:
README (not yet complete documentation)
run_parse.py (run the parser with Swedish grammar)
parse.py (the grammar for Swedish, written by Beata Megyesi and Olav Bandmann)
spark.py (Earley parser implemented by Aycock in python)
sparkgen.py (parser rule reading written by Olav Bandmann)
fixdot.py (read lines)
tokenastdot.py (for printing tree representation, written by Olav Bandmann)
isofonts.ps (enables dot-generated PostScript files to use isolatin fonts)
example.ps (example on a tree structure representation)


To be able to run the parser you have to use python 2.1.1 or a later version. First, edit the python path in run_parse.py to the correct one. 
(To find out the path to python, type 
$ which python)


Go to the parser directory and run the parser by typing:
$run_parse.py <option> <first line no> <number of lines> <infile> <outfile>

where <option> is one of
	-t (tagged representation),
	-p (parenthesis representation),
	-i (indented representation),
	-d (tree representation as a postscript (.ps) file; works for one sentence at a time only. This switch requires installed graphviz developed at AT&T. 


<first line no> is the no of the line you want to parse from

<number of lines> is the total no of lines you wish to parse

<infile> the name of the file that you wish to parse
The infile has to be tokenized, one sentence per line, and the words have to be
annotated with PAROLE tags. The word and the tag has to be separated by '/',

For example, if you want to parse the first ten lines of the file INFILE and
wish to have the OUTPUT in indented format in the OUTFILE, type the fóllowing:
$run_parse.py -i 1 10 INFILE OUTFILE

Categories used to parse texts, i.e. the syntactic classes

To be able to represent the whole hierarchical phrase structure, eight types of phrases are used. Some of categories correspond to chunks, e.g.  AP, ADVP, and verb clusters. Other categories are designed to be able to handle arguments on the right hand side of the phrasal head, or to handle co-ordinated phrases, such as maximal adjective phrases. The phrase categories are listed below, each followed by a brief explanation and an example.

Adverb Phrase (AdvP) consists of adverbs that can modify adjectives, numerical
expressions or verbs. e.g. very   

Minimal Adjective Phrase (APMIN) constitutes the adjectival head and its
possible modifiers, e.g. AdvP and/or prepositional phrase. e.g. very
interesting 

Maximal Adjective Phrase (APMAX) includes more than one AP with a delimiter
or a conjunction in between.e.g. very interesting and nice  

Noun Phrase (NP) may include the head noun and its modifiers to the left,
e.g. determiners, nouns in genitive, possessive pronouns, numerical
expressions, APMIN, APMAX, and/or compound nouns. Thus, possessive
expressions do not split an NP into two noun phrases like in the
CoNLL-2000 shared task on chunking. e.g. Pilger's very interesting and nice
book   

Prepositional Phrase (PP) consists of one or several prepositions delimited by a conjunction and one or several NPs, or in
elliptical expressions an AP only. e.g. about politics    

Verb Cluster (VC) consists of a continuous verb group belonging to
the same verb phrase without any intervening constituents like NP or
AdvP. e.g. would have been 

Infinitive Phrase (InfP) includes an infinite verb together with the infinite
particle and may contain AdvP and/or verbal particles. e.g. to go out
 
Numeral Expression (SIFFERP) consists of numerals with their possible
modifiers, for example AP or AdvP. e.g. several thousands 

Please note, that the grammatical categories do not represent neither clauses, such as relative clauses, nor sentences. These structures are planned to be analyzed in a later stage. 
Also, there is another version of the parser which includes detection of maximal projection of noun phrases including relative clauses. If you are intrested, please, contact bea@stp.lingfil.uu.se.
